A simple dress-up / makeover and tile-matching game

This will be my first project using what I've learned so far of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When I was a kid I used to play a ton of dress-up and make-over games, so I wanted to capture that vibe.
Of course, my skills aren't super good enough yet to make a real dress-up game, so I'm making a simple tile-matching version.

I'm making this game for fun and to challenege myself and show what I can do.
